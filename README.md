This project will involve making a website using both html and css with the same shape as
the website shown in the image "01.png" and with the same formatting as specified in
the image "02.png".
This will also involve downloading images that can be placed into the website.
This will provide a holistic test of my html and css skills so far taught to me by The Odin Project.
